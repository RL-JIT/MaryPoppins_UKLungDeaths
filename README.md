One of my closest friends is a chimney sweeper and spends a lot of time breathing in coal particles.  
His friends are chimney sweepers as well.  Therefore, Lung health is an important and personal issue for me.
This repository contains an [R notebook](./Lung_Deaths_1.rmd) with my analysis of a built-in dataset in R regarding lung deaths in the UK, our home country.
